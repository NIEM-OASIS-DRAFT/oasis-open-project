# NIEM Technical Architecture Committee (NTAC) Governance

This document amplifies the [NIEM OASIS community governance](GOVERNANCE.md) document. It incorporates all provisions of that document. In case of conflict, that parent document controls. This document changes infrequently by the process defined below.

### Composition

Nominees for the NTAC can be submitted by any individual to the PGB. NTAC members are appointed at the discretion of the PGB, and are reconfirmed by the PGB on a 2 year basis, or until they voluntarily resign or are recalled according to the recall procedure outlined below.

The NTAC must at all times have a chair or two co-chairs. The NTAC chair or co-chairs are confirmed annually by the NTAC itself via a call for nominations, and if required, a [full majority vote](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/oasis-defined-terms-2018-05-22#dFullMajority) of the TSC.

### Decisions

For most decisions, the NTAC operates by [lazy consensus](https://community.apache.org/committers/lazyConsensus.html). The NTAC may, at its own discretion, delegate authority on minor technical decisions to Maintainers in the community, including but not limited to:

- Tagging of *minor versions* of a project
- Creation and merging/removal of feature branches
- Acceptance or rejection of specific defects, feature requests, user stories
- Merging of pull requests

Decisions on the following items must be made based on a [Simple Majority Vote](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/oasis-defined-terms-2018-05-22#dSimpleMajority)

- Tagging / releasing of a new *major version* of a project
- Recommending work to the PGB for promotion to the standards track
- Appointment of new Maintainers

## Updating Governance

All substantive changes in Governance require a [full majority vote](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/oasis-defined-terms-2018-05-22#dFullMajority) of the PGB.
